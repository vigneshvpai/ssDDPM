# ssDDPM: Self-supervised denoising diffusion probabilistic models for abdominal DW-MRI

This repository contains an implementation of Self-Supervised Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (ssDDPM) specifically designed for abdominal diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) reconstruction and enhancement. This implementation is based on the research paper published in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.
